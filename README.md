# About Me

I am now a Postdoc on AI+Academy in Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University(PolyU),fortunately supervised by Prof. Hongxia Yang. I am also a technical staff focusing on pre-training MoE-LLMs at infix.ai.

## Education and Work Experience

I finished my first Postdoc from Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University on LLMs and Agents, Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering, Deep Learning and Machine Learning, specializing in training LLMs including pre-training, mid-training and post-training; knowledge and reasoning in LLMs involving RAG and deep research; and Agents including large-model agentization for downstream tasks like AI4S and agent large-modelization to explore the nature of intelligence. I earned my PhD degree in Engineering Physics at Tsinghua University along with a strong interest in mathematics, and I also had the privilege of visiting UC Berkeley during his doctoral studies. I obtained my bachelor degree from Material Sciences at Huazhong University of Science and Technology（HUST）.
