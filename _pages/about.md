## About Me

I am now a Postdoc on AI+Academy in Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences of Hong Kong Polytechnic University(PolyU),fortunately supervised by respected and renowned Prof. Hongxia Yang. I am also a technical staff focusing on MoE-LLMs Pre-training at infix.ai.

I completed my first Postdoc in Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University on LLMs and Agents, Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering, Deep Learning and Machine Learning, specializing in (1) training LLMs including pre-training, mid-training and post-training; (2) knowledge and reasoning in LLMs involving RAG and deep research; and (3) Agents including large-model agentization for downstream tasks like AI4S and agent large-modelization to explore the nature of intelligence. I earned my PhD degree in Engineering Physics at Tsinghua University along with a strong interest in mathematics, and I also had the privilege of visiting UC Berkeley(2017-2018) during my doctoral studies. I obtained my bachelor degree in Material Sciences at Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST).
